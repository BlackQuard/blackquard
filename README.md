                                           ✨ Developer, DevOps, Security Researcher | Serbia ✨

Several years experience in: PHP, Node.js, Go, Java, C#, C++, C, Ruby, Python, Rust, Perl, Bash, Redis, Memcached, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreeSQL. I enjoy doing it as a little side project to help those who need it.

Everything I know is self taught, growing my knowledge and understanding every day.

If you need a System Administrator, DevOps, Security Reasearcher or developer then you know what to do.
